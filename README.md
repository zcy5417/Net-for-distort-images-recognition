We train VGG16 model at 87.87% test accuracy on cifar-10,when we add gaussian noise(variance of 0.01) and blur(gaussian kernel of 1.0) to 32Ã—32 test images of cifar-10,the prediction accuracy falls down to 32.55% and 43.32% respectively.We downsample the inputs and upsample the corresponding feature maps with different size,find it can produce higher prediction accuracy.
The pristine test images are like:
